# fixmesleep

vibe coded MCP and other stuff to fix my sleep. general idea:
- MCP with access to my ultrahuman ring's data
- give MCP to [poke](https://poke.com) so it proactively yells at me to stay healthy
- log at health.charliemeyer.xyz on a website ++ allow poke to access historical/longitudinal data and vibe ai data analysis on my health data
